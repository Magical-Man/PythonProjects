# PythonProjects
Some small python projects a beginner is working on


Just some Python projects for fun that an absolute beginner (Hopefully not for long) is working on
If you would like to use some of them then that is great, and it is even better if you find an error, because if you do, and then make the edit, or tell me, then I can go and fix it! Or if you don't want to use any of them that fine, and you can just totally ignore this!
